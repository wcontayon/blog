## Hi, I'm Comlan William CONTAYON

First of all, thanks for reading. I'm happy you've landed on my blog and even happier you want to know a little more about me.

I'm a senior .NET developer (C#), working in France, but born in Ivoary Coast. I work primarily with .Net/.NetCore, ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core and Azure, to help produce amazing softwares for customer as a Senior Consultant (Software Engineering).

Outside of my work, I maintain a strong interest and enthusiasm for development and being part of the fantastic .NET community. I consume many blog posts, podcasts and videos to learn about the new technologies available to me. I’m very focused on the new ASP.NET Core and .Net Runtime product from Microsoft; blogging extensively about that.

I’m contributing sometimes to some open source projets around .Net AspNetCore, Microsoft Kiota . You can contribute via their github account.

I'm also maintain my framework [*Adom.Framework*](https://github.com/wcontayon/Adom.Framework), and I'll be very happy to have others contributors.

When not coding or learning about coding, I enjoy walks, travelling and tennis.
